# GryfApp-Web
Website version of GryfApp project which was designed as android mobile application.

## Description
GryfApp is an application designed to help to stay in touch with my gym buddies (*Gryf* is the name of our local gym) . It helps to schedudle trainings and shows which stations are going to be more likely occupied by showing workout type(e.g. legs workout). With this application there is no need to type messages to schedudle your workout with your friends, you just simply post your training informations on GryfApp and if your friends want to come together they will see which time you're going to be on spot.

## Usage
If you want to post your workout on GryfApp you have to be logged in. If you are already logged in the process is really simple, you have to fill empty fields with your name (which is going to be shown for your friends), date, time and workout type. All posts are gathered on *Terminarz* page and they are going to be shown if they are not 
outdated.
